Prompt: "How do I deploy my iOS App to the Apple store?"

Response:
```
Deploying your iOS App to the Apple store involves several steps:

    Code Signing: Ensure your app is properly signed with an Apple developer account. You need to create a distribution certificate and a provisioning profile.

    Archive and Validate your App: Use Xcode to create an archive of your app. Then validate your app using the "Validate App" option in Xcode.

    Submit your App to App Store Connect: Use Xcode's "Distribute App" option to upload your app to App Store Connect.

    Fill Out App Information: In App Store Connect, fill out your app's name, description, category, keywords, and other metadata. You'll also need to upload screenshots of your app.

    Set Up App Store Pricing and Availability: In App Store Connect, set your app's pricing (or choose free) and select the countries where your app will be available.

    Submit for Review: Submit your app for review in App Store Connect. Once it's reviewed and approved, it will be available in the Apple App Store.

Remember to check the official Apple documentation for the most accurate and detailed steps.
